# GeorgiaTech-Campus-Navigation-Systems

**üó∫Ô∏è Georgia Tech Campus Navigation System üó∫Ô∏è**

Welcome to team 6's GitHub Organization! <br>
This is the home of our Campus Navigation System project ‚Äî a fun (and hopefully useful) tool that helps students, staff, and visitors easily find their way around campus. 

**What‚Äôs this project about?**

We aim to build a navigation system that makes campus routes easy to understand and provide clear and friendly route guidance. 

Use cases: <br>
- Students rushing to class <br>
- Visitors exploring campus <br>
- Staff finding the fastest path between buildings <br>

**Cool features**

- Step-by-step directions with estimated travel time <br>
- Easy-to-follow turn-by-turn instructions <br>
- Future expansion: choose your transportation mode (walk, bike, shuttle!) <br>

**Data and graph construction**

We construct a road‚Äìbuilding adjacency graph for the Georgia Tech campus 
using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.

- **Roads**: only motor-vehicle-accessible roads are kept.  
- **Buildings**: each building is represented by its geometric centroid, which is projected to the nearest road segment (using point-to-segment distance).  
- **Projection**: the projection point is added to the graph, and the corresponding road edge is split to preserve distances.  
- **Final Output**: an adjacency list **Adj**, where
  - For each node *i*, we store its set of neighbors that are directly connected.  
  - Each neighbor *j* is stored together with the corresponding edge distance *d(i,j)*.  
  - Formally:
    ```
    Adj[i] = { (j, d(i,j)) | j ‚àà Neighbors(i) }
    ```
  
This pipeline transforms raw OSM data into a unified road‚Äìbuilding graph model,
which can be used for shortest-path search, parking analysis, and other 
network-based computations.
