\section*{Introduction}
Navigation systems are essential for guiding users efficiently to their destinations, improving travel time, safety, and overall convenience. In addition, navigation systems offer users reassurance when traveling in unfamiliar areas, reducing anxiety and enhancing confidence in reaching their destinations. This project is inspired by such systems and aims to develop a vehicle navigation prototype specifically for the Georgia Tech campus. By modeling the campus road network as a graph, the system can compute optimal routes and provide results including estimated travel time, shortest path distance, and turn-by-turn instructions. This prototype not only facilitates navigation within a constrained environment but also serves as a foundation for potential extensions, such as real-time traffic updates, dynamic rerouting, and deployment in larger urban areas.

\section*{Literature Review}
Navigation systems play a vital role in improving mobility by enabling users to efficiently reach destinations while reducing travel time and uncertainty. For constrained environments such as university campuses, OpenStreetMap (OSM) has proven to be a reliable open-source dataset for routing applications, as it provides accessible road and building data that can be transformed into graph structures suitable for shortest-path algorithms \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-10601-9_13, s18020509}. Several campus navigation prototypes have successfully applied OSM, highlighting its adaptability for small-scale routing tasks.

Graph-based modeling forms the foundation of most navigation systems, where intersections and road segments are represented as nodes and edges. To connect buildings to the network, geometric techniques such as centroid projection are commonly employed. These approaches are widely used in map-matching research to systematically link arbitrary points, such as building entrances, to accessible roads \cite{Map-mappingResearch}. Once modeled, shortest-path algorithms such as Dijkstra’s and A* are effective for campus-scale applications. While Dijkstra guarantees optimality, A* enhances efficiency by incorporating heuristics like Euclidean distance \cite{madkour2017survey}. Advanced algorithms designed for large-scale, real-time routing (e.g., Contraction Hierarchies) offer limited additional benefit at the campus scale.

Equally important is the generation of user-friendly navigation instructions. Research shows that effective guidance depends on identifying decision points, computing turning angles, and translating them into intuitive directions such as “turn left” or “go straight” \cite{RICHTER2008233}. Studies further emphasize the value of simplicity and landmarks in reducing user disorientation, underlining that navigation is not only a technical problem but also a human-centered design challenge.

In summary, existing literature confirms the feasibility of developing a campus-scale navigation system using OSM data, graph modeling, and classical shortest-path algorithms. Simplified assumptions, such as constant travel speed and geometric building linkage, align with prior work, while future opportunities include integrating landmarks or augmented reality features to improve usability.

\section*{Objectives}
The objective of this project is to design and implement a navigation system of the Georgia Tech campus. The system aims to assist users in finding the shortest route between a starting point and destination. By using a graph-based representation of the campus road network, the system provides not only the shortest path but also detailed route information to facilitate navigation. The core goal is to demonstrate a functional vehicle routing prototype that can serve as a foundation for future development of full-scale navigation systems.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section*{Data Descriptions}
\subsection{Data Scource}
In this study, we aim to construct an adjacency matrix that represents the connections between campus buildings and the road network. The data source is \textbf{OpenStreetMap (OSM)}, an open geospatial platform collaboratively maintained and updated by contributors worldwide. OSM stores data in a structured format consisting of \textbf{nodes}, \textbf{ways}, and \textbf{relations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Buildings} are represented as closed polygons, defined by a series of latitude–longitude coordinates (nodes). Each building polygon is associated with descriptive tags, such as \texttt{building=yes} and \texttt{name=Tech Tower}.

    \item \textbf{Roads} are represented as polylines (collections of line segments) defined by ordered nodes. Road attributes include type (e.g., \texttt{highway=primary}, \texttt{highway=residential}) and access restrictions (e.g., \texttt{network\_type=drive}).
\end{itemize}


For this phase, we extracted \textbf{motor-vehicle-accessible roads} (\texttt{network\_type=drive}) within the Georgia Tech campus and selected \textbf{teaching buildings where CSE courses are held this semester}.

\subsection*{Modeling Assumptions}
To connect buildings with the road network, we make the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parking locations must lie on motor-vehicle roads,} i.e., cars must park alongside the road rather than on arbitrary open areas.
    \item \textbf{Walking distance simplification}: the walking distance is approximated as the straight-line distance between the building centroid and a point on the nearest road segment, instead of using the actual pedestrian path network.
    \item \textbf{Definition of shortest distance}: for each road, the shortest distance from the building centroid is defined as the \textbf{point-to-line-segment projection distance}, rather than simply the Euclidean distance to an endpoint of the road.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Processing Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Road Network Construction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Download campus road data from OSM, retaining only motor-vehicle-accessible roads.
        \item For roads stored as curved geometries (\texttt{LineString} with multiple intermediate points), split them into straight-line segments to enable accurate point-to-segment projection.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Building Data Extraction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Download campus building data from OSM, filtering for target teaching buildings (i.e., those hosting CSE courses).
        \item Remove records without names or with duplicates to ensure data consistency.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Centroid Calculation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each building polygon, compute its geometric centroid, which serves as the representative location of the building.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Projection onto Roads
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each building centroid, compute the shortest distance to every road segment using point-to-segment projection.
        \item Identify the nearest road segment and project the centroid orthogonally onto it, yielding a projection point.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Graph Update
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Insert the projection point as a new node in the road graph.
        \item Split the corresponding road edge into two segments: from the original road start node to the projection point, and from the projection point to the road end node. Update the edge lengths using great-circle (haversine) distances.
        \item Record the mapping between each building and its associated projection node, along with the projection distance.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Adjacency Matrix Construction (\textbf{NEED TO BE UPDATED})
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Example}
To illustrate the dataset construction process, we present a visualization of the resulting campus model. In this example, we included \textbf{all motor-vehicle roads} from the OSM database, while the set of buildings was restricted to three representative teaching facilities: Armstrong Residence Hall, Baker Building, and John Lewis Student Center.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Road nodes} are shown as white points. Adjacent nodes are connected by straight line segments, forming the underlying road network.
    \item \textbf{Buildings} are highlighted as red polygons, corresponding to the selected footprints extracted from OSM.
    \item \textbf{Building centroids} are represented by blue points, marking the geometric center of each building polygon.
    \item \textbf{Projection points} are shown as green crosses, indicating the nearest locations on the road network to each centroid.
    \item Each centroid is connected to its projection point with a dashed black line, demonstrating the geometric link between buildings and roads.
\end{itemize}

This visualization shows how the campus environment is represented in our model: the complete road network is preserved, while only a chosen subset of buildings is considered. Each building is systematically anchored to the road network through projection, providing a consistent basis for constructing the adjacency matrix and performing subsequent analyses. For comparison, we also include a ground-truth campus map from OSM, in which the corresponding buildings are highlighted in red.

\section*{Algorithms}

\subsection*{Graph Representation}
The Georgia Tech Navigation System is modeled as a weighted, directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ denotes the vertex (node) set representing the road intersections, curve points along road segments, and projected building point on the road.
    \item $E$ denotes the edge set representing the road segments weighted by haversine distance. For two-way streets, edges are inserted in both directions while for one-way streets only a single directed edge is created.
\end{itemize}
Given that the Georgia Tech road network is a sparse graph with most intersections connecting to only a handful of roads, instead of storing the graph as a adjacency matrix which requires $O(|V|^2)$ for storage, adjacency list (which requires $O(|V|+|E|)$ for storage) is a more natural and efficient choice in this case. Besides, it is also easy to establish an adjacency list since the extracted nodes from OSM have a \texttt{neighbors} tag.

\subsection*{A* Search}

Unlike exhaustive methods such as Breadth-First Search or Dijkstra’s Algorithm, which may expand nearly all nodes in the graph, A* improves efficiency with heuristic-guided approach.

A* search algorithm evaluates nodes by using the function:
\[
f(n) = g(n)+h(n),
\]
where $g(n)$ represents the exact cost of the path from the starting point to any vertex $n$, and $h(n)$ represents the heuristic estimated cost from vertex $n$ to the goal. Each time through the main loop, it examines the vertex $n$ with lowest $f(n)$.

In this case, we use the haversine distance from a vertex to the destination as the heuristic
\[
h(n) =  2R \cdot \arcsin\!\left( \sqrt{ \sin^2\!\left(\frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)\sin^2\!\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right) } \right),
\] where $R$ denotes the radius of the Earth, $\phi$ denotes the latitude and $\lambda$ denotes the longitude.

\subsection*{Route Metrics}
For each query, the algorithm outputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shortest-path distance} (i.e. sum of edge weights).
    \item \textbf{Estimated travel time} $t = d/v$, where $v$ is assumed average vehicle speed.
    \item \textbf{Node sequence}: ordered list of graph vertices along the path.
    \item \textbf{Edge sequence}: road segments traversed with distances.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Turn-by-Turn Instruction Generation}

To convert raw node sequences into human-readable directions, we utilize the bearing angles $\theta$ between consecutive edges, and determine the instruction by a function $\text{intersection}(\theta)$:
\[
\text{Instruction}(\theta) =
\begin{cases}
\text{Straight}, & |\theta| < 30^\circ \\[6pt]
\text{Left Turn}, & 30^\circ \leq \theta < 150^\circ \ \wedge \ \text{cross}(\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2) > 0 \\[6pt]
\text{Right Turn}, & 30^\circ \leq \theta < 150^\circ \ \wedge \ \text{cross}(\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2) < 0 \\[6pt]
\text{U-turn}, & |\theta| \geq 150^\circ
\end{cases}
\]
where $\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2$ are consecutive edge vectors, $\theta = \arccos\!\left( \dfrac{\mathbf{e}_1 \cdot \mathbf{e}_2}{\|\mathbf{e}_1\|\|\mathbf{e}_2\|} \right)$, and $\text{cross}(\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2)$ is the determinant of 2 by 2 matrix formed by two edge vector. 

These thresholds reflect human perception, reducing false turn instructions from slight bends while still capturing sharp changes in direction.
