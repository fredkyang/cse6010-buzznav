abstract="We present a web-based, multi-lingual, campus guidance system with emphasis on pedestrian navigation aimed at providing support for delegates attending International Conferences at the National University of Ireland Maynooth (NUIM) campus. A special campus guidance system could improve the logistics of the conference and potentially attract more delegates to the conference. The Cloudmade Web Map Lite API which uses OpenStreetMap has been used for creating this interface. The system generates shortest pedestrian paths using both outdoor pavements and indoor corridors between various buildings and points of interests (POI). For visual assistance in pedestrian navigation geotagged images are used along the path at certain points in the route, such as road intersections, when the user needs to get their orientation correct. The interface is currently available in both English and Chinese language.",

ABSTRACT = {Tailored routing and navigation services utilized by wheelchair users require certain information about sidewalk geometries and their attributes to execute efficiently. Except some minor regions/cities, such detailed information is not present in current versions of crowdsourced mapping databases including OpenStreetMap. CAP4Access European project aimed to use (and enrich) OpenStreetMap for making it fit to the purpose of wheelchair routing. In this respect, this study presents a modified methodology based on data mining techniques for constructing sidewalk geometries using multiple GPS traces collected by wheelchair users during an urban travel experiment. The derived sidewalk geometries can be used to enrich OpenStreetMap to support wheelchair routing. The proposed method was applied to a case study in Heidelberg, Germany. The constructed sidewalk geometries were compared to an official reference dataset (“ground truth dataset”). The case study shows that the constructed sidewalk network overlays with 96% of the official reference dataset. Furthermore, in terms of positional accuracy, a low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value (0.93 m) is achieved. The article presents our discussion on the results as well as the conclusion and future research directions.},

abstract = {Humans adapt the instructions provided in route directions to the assumed spatial knowledge of the receivers; the majority of route directions is provided to wayfinders with at least partial spatial knowledge of the environment. However, today’s navigation systems assume no a priori knowledge. Most of current research addresses this by exploring means to personalize assistance through the capture of knowledge about individual users. Accordingly, such systems require an extended learning phase. In this paper, an approach to adaptive route directions based on a combination of turn-by-turn directions and destination descriptions is presented. This approach does not rely on information on a wayfinder’s previous knowledge. Instead, a wayfinder can adjust the type and detail of the presented information via dialog. The paper focuses on the problem formalization and its algorithmic realization; the approach is generic with respect to the modality of the actual dialog (e.g., verbal or key-press based computer interfaces). The paper provides a contribution towards non-static, adaptive route direction services.}
